Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999401588235294">This paper defines a generative probabilistic model of parse trees, which we call PCFG-LA. This model is an extension of PCFG in which non-terminal symbols are augmented with latent variables. Finegrained CFG rules are automatically induced from a parsed corpus by training a PCFG-LA model using an EM-algorithm. Because exact parsing with a PCFG-LA is NP-hard, several approximations are described and empirically compared. In experiments using the Penn WSJ corpus, our automatically trained model gave a performance of 86.6% (F, sentences 40 words), which is comparable to that of an unlexicalized PCFG parser created using extensive manual feature selection.</bodyText>

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970170731707">Variants of PCFGs form the basis of several broadcoverage and high-precision parsers (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 1999; Klein and Manning, 2003). In those parsers, the strong conditional independence assumption made in vanilla treebank PCFGs is weakened by annotating non-terminal symbols with many ‘features’ (Goodman, 1997; Johnson, 1998). Examples of such features are head words of constituents, labels of ancestor and sibling nodes, and subcategorization frames of lexical heads. Effective features and their good combinations are normally explored using trial-and-error. This paper defines a generative model of parse trees that we call PCFG with latent annotations (PCFG-LA). This model is an extension of PCFG models in which non-terminal symbols are annotated with latent variables. The latent variables work just like the features attached to non-terminal symbols. A fine-grained PCFG is automatically induced from parsed corpora by training a PCFG-LA model using an EM-algorithm, which replaces the manual feature selection used in previous research. The main focus of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of the automatically trained models in parsing. Because exact inference with a PCFG-LA, i.e., selection of the most probable parse, is NP-hard, we are forced to use some approximation of it. We empirically compared three different approximation methods. One of the three methods gives a performance of 86.6% (F, sentences 40 words) on the standard test set of the Penn WSJ corpus. Utsuro et al. (1996) proposed a method that automatically selects a proper level of generalization of non-terminal symbols of a PCFG, but they did not report the results of parsing with the obtained PCFG. Henderson’s parsing model (Henderson, 2003) has a similar motivation as ours in that a derivation history of a parse tree is compactly represented by induced hidden variables (hidden layer activation of a neural network), although the details of his approach is quite different from ours.</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999820923076923">Using dynamic programming, the theoretical bound of the time complexity of the summation in Eq. 1 is reduced to be proportional to the number of non-terminal nodes in a parse tree. However, the calculation at node still has a cost that exponentially grows with the number of ’s daughters because we must sum up the probabilities of combinations of latent annotation symbols for a node with daughters. We thus took a kind of transformation/detransformation approach, in which a tree is binarized before parameter estimation and restored to its original form after parsing. The details of the binarization are explained in Section 4. Using syntactically annotated corpora as training data, we can estimate the parameters of a PCFGLA model using an EM algorithm. The algorithm is a special variant of the inside-outside algorithm of Pereira and Schabes (1992). Several recent work also use similar estimation algorithm as ours, i.e, inside-outside re-estimation on parse trees (Chiang and Bikel, 2002; Shen, 2004). The rest of this section precisely defines PCFGLA models and briefly explains the estimation algorithm. The derivation of the estimation algorithm is largely omitted; see Pereira and Schabes (1992) for details.</bodyText>

Although we omit the details, we can prove the NP-hardness by observing that a stochastic tree substitution grammar (STSG) can be represented by a PCFG-LA model in a similar way to one described by Goodman (1996a), and then using the NP-hardness of STSG parsing (Sima´an, 2002). The difficulty of the exact optimization in Eq.4 forces us to use some approximations of it. The rest of this section describes three different approximations, which are empirically compared in the next section. The first method simply limits the number of candidate parse trees compared in Eq.4; we first create N-best parses using a PCFG and then, within the N-best parses, select the one with the highest probability in terms of the PCFG-LA. The other two methods are a little more complicated, and we explain them in separate subsections.</bodyText>

Those algorithms optimize some evaluation metric of parse trees other than the posterior probability , e.g., (expected) labeled constituent recall or (expected) recall rate of dependency relations contained in a parse. It is in contrast with our approach where (approximated) posterior probability is optimized.</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999943333333334">We conducted four sets of experiments. In the first set of experiments, the degree of dependency of trained models on initialization was examined because EM-style algorithms yield different results with different initial values of parameters. In the second set of experiments, we examined the relationship between model types and their parsing performances. In the third set of experiments, we compared the three parsing methods described in the previous section. Finally, we show the result of a parsing experiment using the standard test set. We used sections 2 through 20 of the Penn WSJ corpus as training data and section 21 as heldout data. The heldout data was used for early stopping; i.e., the estimation was stopped when the rate of increase in the likelihood of the heldout data became lower than a certain threshold.</bodyText>

Note that models created using different binarization methods have different numbers of parameters for the same . The parsing performances were measured using F scores of the parse trees that were obtained by re-ranking of 1000-best parses by a PCFG. We can see that the parsing performance gets better as the model size increases. We can also see that models of roughly the same size yield similar performances regardless of the binarization scheme used for them, except the models created using LEFT binarization with small numbers of parameters ( and ). Taking into account the dependency on initial values at the level shown in the previous experiment, we cannot say that any single model is superior to the other models when the sizes of the models are large enough. The results shown in Figure 7 suggest that we could further improve parsing performance by increasing the model size. However, both the memory size and the training time are more than linear in , and the training time for the largest ( ) models was about 15 hours for the models created using CENTER-PARENT, CENTER-HEAD, and LEFT and about 20 hours for the model created using RIGHT. To deal with larger (e.g., = 32 or 64) models, we therefore need to use a model search that reduces the number of parameters while maintaining the model’s performance, and an approximation during training to reduce the training time.</bodyText>

Our result is lower than the state-of-the-art lexicalized PCFG parsers (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 1999), but comparable to the unlexicalized PCFG parser of Klein and Manning (2003). Klein and Manning’s PCFG is annotated by many linguistically motivated features that they found using extensive manual feature selection.

We thus took a kind of transformation/detransformation approach, in which a tree is binarized before parameter estimation and restored to its original form after parsing. The details of the binarization are explained in Section 4. Using syntactically annotated corpora as training data, we can estimate the parameters of a PCFGLA model using an EM algorithm. The algorithm is a special variant of the inside-outside algorithm of Pereira and Schabes (1992). Several recent work also use similar estimation algorithm as ours, i.e, inside-outside re-estimation on parse trees (Chiang and Bikel, 2002; Shen, 2004). The rest of this section precisely defines PCFGLA models and briefly explains the estimation algorithm. The derivation of the estimation algorithm is largely omitted; see Pereira and Schabes (1992) for details. 2.1 Model definition We define a PCFG-LA as a tuple , where a set of observable non-terminal symbols a set of terminal symbols a set of latent annotation symbols a set of observable CFG rules the probability of the occurrence of a complete symbol at a root node the probability of a rule We use for non-terminal symbols in ; for terminal symbols in ; .

Because exact parsing with a PCFG-LA is NP-hard, several approximations are described and empirically compared. In experiments using the Penn WSJ corpus, our automatically trained model gave a performance of 86.6% (F, sentences 40 words), which is comparable to that of an unlexicalized PCFG parser created using extensive manual feature selection. 1 Introduction Variants of PCFGs form the basis of several broadcoverage and high-precision parsers (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 1999; Klein and Manning, 2003). In those parsers, the strong conditional independence assumption made in vanilla treebank PCFGs is weakened by annotating non-terminal symbols with many ‘features’ (Goodman, 1997; Johnson, 1998). Examples of such features are head words of constituents, labels of ancestor and sibling nodes, and subcategorization frames of lexical heads. Effective features and their good combinations are normally explored using trial-and-error. This paper defines a generative model of parse trees that we call PCFG with latent annotations (PCFG-LA). This model is an extension of PCFG models in which non-termin</context>

The parses remaining in the chart were the candidate parses for the second and the third methods. The different lines for the second and the third methods correspond to different values of . The third method outperforms the other two methods unless the parse time is very limited (i.e., 1 4The PCFG used in creating the candidate parses is roughly the same as the one that Klein and Manning (2003) call a ‘markovised PCFG with vertical order = 2 and horizontal order = 1’ and was extracted from Section 02-20. The PCFG itself gave a performance of 79.6/78.5 LP/LR on the development set. This PCFG was also used in the experiment in Section 4.4.

We used the instance of the four compared in the second experiment that gave the best results on the development set. Several previously reported results on the same test set are also listed in Table 2. Our result is lower than the state-of-the-art lexicalized PCFG parsers (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 1999), but comparable to the unlexicalized PCFG parser of Klein and Manning (2003). Klein and Manning’s PCFG is annotated by many linguistically motivated features that they found using extensive manual feature selection. In contrast, our method induces all parameters automatically, except that manually written head-rules are used in binarization. Thus, our method can extract a considerable amount of hidden regularity from parsed corpora. However, our result is worse than the lexicalized parsers despite the fact that our model has access to words in the sentences. It suggests that certain types of information used in those lexicalized 5Actually, the number of parses contain</context>

We thus took a kind of transformation/detransformation approach, in which a tree is binarized before parameter estimation and restored to its original form after parsing. The details of the binarization are explained in Section 4. Using syntactically annotated corpora as training data, we can estimate the parameters of a PCFGLA model using an EM algorithm. The algorithm is a special variant of the inside-outside algorithm of Pereira and Schabes (1992).

The main focus of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of the automatically trained models in parsing. Because exact inference with a PCFG-LA, i.e., selection of the most probable parse, is NP-hard, we are forced to use some approximation of it. We empirically compared three different approximation methods. One of the three methods gives a performance of 86.6% (F, sentences 40 words) on the standard test set of the Penn WSJ corpus. Utsuro et al. (1996) proposed a method that automatically selects a proper level of generalization of non-terminal symbols of a PCFG, but they did not report the results of parsing with the obtained PCFG. Henderson’s parsing model (Henderson, 2003) has a similar motivation as ours in that a derivation history of a parse tree is compactly represented by induced hidden variables (hidden layer activation of a neural network), although the details of his approach is quite different from ours. 2 Probabilistic model PCFG-LA is a generative probabilistic model of parse trees.
