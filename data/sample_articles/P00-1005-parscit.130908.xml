Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996582034482759">Pattern-Based Machine Translation is one of the machine translation methods which performs syntactic analysis and structure transfer at the same time using bilingual patterns. PBMT is used to expand the length of patterns up to sentencelength in order to reduce ambiguities in translation, but it brought out the problem of rapidly increased patterns. We propose a model which shortens the length of patterns to phrase-length and reduces ambiguities in translation by using twolevel translation pattern selection method. In the first level, the proper translation patterns are selected by using a hybrid method of exact example matching and semantic constraint by thesaurus. In the second level, the most natural translation pattern for the verb phrase is selected among the selected translation pattern categories by using statistic information of the target language. By using this proposed model, we could shorten the length of patterns without raising the ambiguities in translation.</bodyText>

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999838139534884">A Transfer-Based Machine Translation method generally has four steps (Kim, 1994); morphological analysis of source language, syntactic analysis of source language, structure transfer to the target language, and sentence generation of the target language. In structure transfer step, transfer patterns used to be greatly lexicalized in order to raise the accuracy of translation. Pattern-Based Machine Translation (PBMT) performs both syntactic analysis and structure transfer simultaneously using this lexicalized patterns (Takeda, 1996). PBMT can shorten the translation time and raise the accuracy of syntactic analysis by using the lexicalized patterns. At first, since all patterns were short phrase-length patterns, many syntactic ambiguities occurred in pattern matching. As a result, patterns became longer to sentencelength to reduce ambiguities. But, sentencelength patterns cause pattern sparseness problem, because the same number of sentence-length patterns can cover less sentences than the same number of phrase-length patterns. To overcome this problem, Watanabe and Takeda (1998) adopted example-based approach. However, examplebased approach has some problems. One of the problems is that two different verbs of target language take two semantically similar nouns as objects respectively although a verb of source language takes the nouns as its objects. For example, a Korean verb ta-da' with objects ' bus(bus)' and ' ma/(horse)' is translated into English verbs 'take' and 'ride' respectively. Many researches were done to solve them. They used syntactic collocation (Kim et al., 1996; Lee et al., 1999), semantic constraint by thesaurus (Moon et al., 1998), semantic features (Palmer et al., 1999) and statistical information (Brown et al., 1991; Dagan and Itai, 1994). But when syntactic collocation is used, each example for a verb has the same effect to select the proper word sense of the verb. Consequently, it is difﬁcult to obtain the representative examples and to describe senses which have domains of different size. In addition, when only semantic constraint by thesaurus is used, it is difﬁcult to obtain good translated words because of the insufﬁ— cient thesaurus problem. As a result, we use a hybrid method of both exact example match— ing technique with syntactic collocation and semantic constraint by thesaurus. We use phrase—length patterns to solve pat— tern sparseness problem and propose two level selection method of translation pattern to re— duce the ambiguities of pattern matching.</bodyText>

2 Two level Translation Pattern
Selection Method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98840504">We use only mono—lingual resources to re— duce translation ambiguities. It is almost im— possible to incorporate semantic knowledge of two languages. The mutual information between two different languages can be de— scribed not by one—to—one mapping but by coarse—mapping (Palmer et al., 1999). For ex— ample, a Korean verb phrase pattern ‘NP+lul ssu-da’ can be translated into ‘wear NP’, ‘write NP’, ‘compose NP’, ‘use NP’, or ‘spend NP’. If NP has a meaning [head—gear], then the Korean verb phrase pattern can be trans— lated into ‘wear NP’ or ‘put on NP’. If the headword of NP is ‘don(money)’, then the verb phrase patterns are changed into ‘spend money’. In this way, ‘NP+lul ssu-da’ has ﬁve translation pattern categories. It takes two steps to select the most natural English trans— lation pattern as a corresponding pattern of a Korean pattern: 1) to select possible translation pattern cat— egories, 2) to select the most natural English transla— tion pattern among possible translation pat— tern categories. The ﬁrst step is performed in pattern matching, and the second step in pattern transfer. Among the ambiguities in Korean to En— glish Machine Translation, the ambiguities in Korean pattern matching are reduced by us— ing a hybrid method of exact example match— ing and semantic constraint by thesaurus, and the ambiguities in Korean to English pattern transfer are reduced by using syntactic col— locational information of English (Lee et al., 1999)</bodyText>

2.1 Pattern Matching
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98840504">There are several English translation pat— terns of a Korean verb phrase pattern (e.g. ‘NP+lul ssu-da’ can be translated into ‘wear NP’, ‘write NP’, ‘use NP’ and so on.). We fo— cus on selecting the most natural translation pattern among them. In the ﬁrst step, we divide them into several translation pattern categories with both examples and semantic constraint by Korean thesaurus.</bodyText>

translation pattern selection method
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.996965583333333">Figure 1 shows ﬁve translation pattern cat— egories of ‘NP+lul ssu-da’ by the proposed hybrid method. First three categories are se— mantically constrained by Korean thesaurus. In this case, if the meaning of headword of a noun phrase NP1 is a hyponym or a hyper— nym of the semantic constraint for NP, then NP1 can be matched to NP. For example, ‘32" can be an object of ‘ssu-da’ because the mean— ing [production(language)] of the meanings of ‘32", is a hyponym of [production], (i.e. ‘silul ssu-da’ is matched to ‘NP [production]+lul ssu-da' with the possible translation patterns { 'write NP', 'compose NP'}). At the same time, si' is translated into 'poem' among all English words for the Korean word ' si' , because only 'poem' has the meaning of [production(language)]. Last two translation pattern categories of `NP-k/u/ ssu-da' are constrained by exact example matching method. For example, if and only if the headword of a noun phrase NP1 is ' chun-/yak(strategy)', NP1+ /u/ ssuda' takes { 'adopt a stratagem'} as its translation pattern category. Because the exact example matching method is too rigid, it's better to adopt example-based approach (Watanabe and Takeda, 1998). But, in this paper, we only implemented exact example matching method. The proposed hybrid method of exact example matching and semantic constraint by thesaurus can reduce the number of possible translation patterns and also the ambiguities of pattern matching. Exl) na-nun si-mi chom muk-ko nan daum-e ssu-go sip-da. (I want to write a poem after eating something.) For example, both Korean verbs 'rankda(eat)' and ssu-da(write)' can take si-/u/' as objects in example Exl. muk-da' takes only nouns with meaning [something to eat] as objects, but ssu-da' can take nouns with meaning [production] as an object. As a result, si-/u/' is regared as an object of 'ssu-da', because si' does not have the meaning [something to eat] but has the meaning [production(language)], a hyponymy of [production].</bodyText>

2.2 Pattern Transfer
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999429790697675">After the selection of possible translation pattern categories in pattern matching, the most natural translation pattern among those patterns is selected in pattern transfer. To acquire the most natural English sentence, we use English syntactic collocational information, especially for subject-verb relation and verb-object relation. We regard the English pattern of the most frequent syntactically related pair as the most natural translation pattern. As explained above, 'write NP', 'compose NP' are selected as the translation patterns for NP+ /u/ ssuda', and 'poem' is selected as the translated word for si' in pattern matching. Therefore, 'write poem' and 'compose poem' are the possible translation for si-lul ssu-da'. English verb 'write, compose' and English noun 'poem' appear as verb-object relation in the corpus four times and zero times respectively. Therefore, 'write poem' is selected as the most natural translation for simul ssu-da'. Pattern transfer is needed especially when a verb of source language can translated into several words of target language according to objects, although the verb takes semantically similar nouns as objects. For example, NP in `NP+ /u/ ta-go ka-da' must have the meaning [something to ride], and its translation patterns can be 'ride NP' or 'go by NP'. There are many Korean nouns with the meaning [something to ride] like 'horse', 'car', 'bus', 'train' and so on. When the headword of NP is 'horse' or 'car', NP+ /u/ ta-go ka-da' is usually translated into 'ride NP', but when the headword of NP is 'bus' or 'train', NP+ /u/ ta-go ka-da' is usually translated as 'go by NP'. But the Korean thesaurus, which we used, does not bring out the differences. This problem shows that Korean and English have very different semantic hierarchies of thesaurus construction (Palmer et al., 1999).</bodyText>

2.3 Pattern Scoring
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996">We used Generalized LR parsing (GLR) algorithm (Tomita, 1991) for pattern matching. To prune out nodes made by GLR algorithm during pattern matching, we score each node and remove nodes which have lower score than those of the top ten nodes with the same range and the same syntactic category. To score each node, several methods can be used; the frequency of each pattern in the corpus (Sorniertlamvanich, 1998) and the Korean syntactic collocational information (Yoon, 1998). Since we use very lexicalized patterns, the frequency of each pattern in the corpus is not available. Also we didn't describe syntactic information of the Korean pattern, the Korean syntactic collo— cational information is not useful yet. There— fore, we used following preferences for scoring patterns. A pattern scoring method according to these preferences is shown at Fig— ure 3. In the case of Figure 2, score(VPS) is the sum of (P(c)+a&gt;&lt;score(c)) of all child node 0 of VPS. If c is lexical, then score( 0) 277, otherwise, score( 0) is calculated recursively. For example, score(‘ga’)2score(‘lul’)2score(‘33uda’)277, and score(NP1) and score(NP2) are calcu— lated recursively. P(c) is determined by the constraints for c. If c is lexical, P(c)2ﬂ. If 5 is higher, lexicalized patterns are more preferred. If c is semantically constrained by thesaurus with SC, P(c) is determined by the distance between SC and the real semantic code of c in the thesaurus. If they are closer, P(c) is higher, i.e. second scoring prefence is applied. Function distance(p, SC) means the distance between the semantic code of p and SC. For example, if p has semantic code [111120(human role)] and SC is [111000(hu— man)], distance(111120,111000)22 If c is constrained by exact example matching with EC and the headword of c is included in EC, high score is given to P(c). If c has no constraint, then P(c) is given as a penalty. Let @210, £220, 723.0, 623.0, 6123.0, p=1.0, 77:0.0, $20.8 and NTTLENG261.</bodyText>

After all the nodes are scored recursively with the pattern scoring method, the root node of the best score is regarded as the root of the best Korean pattern tree. After the best Korean pattern tree is selected, this tree is transferred to English pattern tree in pat— tern transfer and the English pattern tree is transferred to the English phrase structure automatically. Then, according to the En— glish phrase structure, the ﬁnal English sen— tence is generated.</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.99997905">We proposed two-level translation pattern selection model to reduce the length of pattern and reduce the ambiguities occurred due to short patterns. In the first step, the ambiguities in the pattern matching is reduced and several translation pattern categories are selected by the hybrid method of exact example matching and semantic constraint by thesaurus. In the second step, the most natural translation pattern is selected by the English syntactic collocational information. In the future, it is needed to use the syntactic collocational information of Korean to reduce ambiguities in pattern matching step. Also it is needed to expand the syntactic collocational information of English, e.g. adjective-noun relation and verb-adverb relation. And research on restoring the necessary information in English sentence has to be done.</bodyText>

To overcome this problem, Watanabe and Takeda (1998) adopted example-based approach. However, examplebased approach has some problems. One of the problems is that two different verbs of target language take two semantically similar nouns as objects respectively although a verb of source language takes the nouns as its objects. For example, a Korean verb ta-da' with objects ' bus(bus)' and ' ma/(horse)' is translated into English verbs 'take' and 'ride' respectively. Many researches were done to solve them.

In structure transfer step, transfer patterns used to be greatly lexicalized in order to raise the accuracy of translation. Pattern-Based Machine Translation (PBMT) performs both syntactic analysis and structure transfer simultaneously using this lexicalized patterns (Takeda, 1996). PBMT can shorten the translation time and raise the accuracy of syntactic analysis by using the lexicalized patterns. At first, since all patterns were short phrase-length patterns, many syntactic ambiguities occurred in pattern matching. As a result, patterns became longer to sentencelength to reduce ambiguities. But, sentencelength patterns cause pattern sparseness problem, because the same number of sentence-length patterns can cover less sentences than the same number of phrase-length patterns. To overcome this problem, Watanabe and Takeda (1998) adopted example-based approach. However, </context>

At the same time, si' is translated into 'poem' among all English words for the Korean word ' si' , because only 'poem' has the meaning of [production(language)]. Last two translation pattern categories of `NP-k/u/ ssu-da' are constrained by exact example matching method. For example, if and only if the headword of a noun phrase NP1 is ' chun-/yak(strategy)', NP1+ /u/ ssuda' takes { 'adopt a stratagem'} as its translation pattern category. Because the exact example matching method is too rigid, it's better to adopt example-based approach (Watanabe and Takeda, 1998). But, in this paper, we only implemented exact example matching method. The proposed hybrid method of exact example matching and semantic constraint by thesaurus can reduce the number of possible translation patterns and also the ambiguities of pattern matching.

For example, both Korean verbs 'rankda(eat)' and ssu-da(write)' can take si-/u/' as objects in example Exl. muk-da' takes only nouns with meaning [something to eat] as objects, but ssu-da' can take nouns with meaning [production] a</context>
